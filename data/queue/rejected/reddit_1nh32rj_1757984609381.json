    {
      "question": "What is the Apex hand and what can it do?",
      "answer": "The Apex hand is a new dexterous robotic hand developed by DexcelRobotics. It is capable of 21 degrees of freedom, allowing it to replicate most human hand functions. Key features include a single-finger force of up to 2.5kg, a vertical lifting capacity of 30kg, human-level response time, sub-millimeter positioning accuracy, and robust tactile sensing capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How strong is the Apex hand?",
      "answer": "The Apex hand is remarkably strong for its size. Each individual finger can exert a force of up to 2.5kg, and the hand has a total vertical lifting capacity of around 30kg. This strength allows the Apex hand to perform tasks like crushing wooden planks that would be difficult for a human hand."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the Apex hand be used to operate a smartphone?",
      "answer": "Yes, one of the key claims about the Apex hand is that it is the first in the industry capable of operating a cell phone with a single hand. Its 21 degrees of freedom and human-level dexterity allow it to precisely manipulate small objects and controls."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of sensors and tactile feedback does the Apex hand have?",
      "answer": "The Apex hand features self-developed flexible electronic \"skin\" that provides advanced tactile sensing. This allows the hand to detect contact, pressure, and texture with a sub-millisecond communication delay and over 1000Hz refresh rate. This high-resolution tactile feedback is crucial for dexterous manipulation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How robust and stable is the Apex hand?",
      "answer": "In addition to its strength and precision, the Apex hand is designed to be highly robust. It can withstand unexpected impacts and maintain stability, making it suitable for real-world applications where the hand may encounter unpredictable forces or disturbances."

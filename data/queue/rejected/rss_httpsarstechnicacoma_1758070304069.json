In China, people are using DeepSeek to try to decode their fortunes. In her report, Lauren Jackson examined \"faith tech\" apps that cost users up to $70 annually, with some platforms claiming to channel divine communication directly.</p>\n<p>Some of the apps address what creators describe as an accessibility problem. \"You don't want to disturb your pastor at three in the morning,\" Krista Rogers, a 61-year-old Ohio resident, told the Times about using the <a href=\"https://www.youversion.com/the-bible-app/\">YouVersion Bible app</a> and ChatGPT for spiritual questions.</p>\n<p>The report also examines platforms that go beyond simple scriptural guidance. While a service like <a href=\"https://www.chatwithgod.ai/\">ChatwithGod</a> operates as a \"spiritual advisor,\" its conversational nature is convincing enough that users often question whether they are speaking directly with a divine being. As its chief executive told the Times, the most frequent question from users is, \"Is this actually God I am talking to?\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/millions-turn-to-ai-chatbots-for-spiritual-guidance-and-confession/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/millions-turn-to-ai-chatbots-for-spiritual-guidance-and-confession/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n                        ",

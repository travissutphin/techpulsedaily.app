      "question": "How will the new restrictions on flirtatious talk and suicide discussions work in practice?",
      "answer": "The details of how the new restrictions will be implemented are not entirely clear. But the general idea is that ChatGPT will be trained to avoid any flirtatious or romantic language when conversing with users it identifies as being under 18.

The goal is to create a safer, more age-appropriate experience for underage ChatGPT users."

      "answer": "OpenAI's decision to restrict ChatGPT's interactions with minors is likely driven by a desire to protect vulnerable young users from potential harms.

    {
      "question": "How will OpenAI enforce the new age restrictions on ChatGPT?",

Regardless, the goal is to create a safer experience for underage users, even if the enforcement mechanisms are not fully spelled out."

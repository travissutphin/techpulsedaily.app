# Drafts Directory

This directory contains articles that are work-in-progress or scheduled for future publication.

## Purpose:
- Store articles being edited
- Queue scheduled posts
- Keep unpublished content separate

## File Naming:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-article-slug.mdx
```

## Workflow:
1. Articles start here after AI processing
2. Admin reviews and edits
3. Once approved, moved to `/content/posts/`

## Automation:
Future enhancement: Auto-publish drafts based on frontmatter schedule date.

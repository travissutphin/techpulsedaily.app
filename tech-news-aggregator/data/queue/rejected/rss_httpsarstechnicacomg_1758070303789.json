And yet, the company has rarely created desktop apps to go with those services. There are a handful, like Drive and Quick Share, but the company's flagship product is only now coming to the desktop. The new Google app for Windows is available now, allowing you to search the web, Google Drive, and even your local files.</p>\n<p>The company stresses that <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/google-app-windows-labs/\">the new app is experimental</a>—it's limited to personal Google accounts, and you may encounter some bugs. The core functionality appears to be solid because it's not trying to do too much. After installation, you can press Alt+Space (or a shortcut of your choice) at any time to bring up a floating Google search bar. Just type your query, and the results page appears in a small window directly below the bar. It can also pull in select Knowledge Graph content, so you may not even have to type the whole query to get the information you need.</p>\n<p>Microsoft's built-in Windows search functionality is notoriously crummy, and even in this experimental form, Google's Chrome OS-style search experience is better. It's fast, pulling up local files, Drive documents, and installed apps in a single interface. Both local files and Drive are optional, so you can use them only for search if you prefer. The app also includes Google Lens, which allows you to select anything on your PC's screen for image search or translation.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/experimental-google-app-brings-web-and-local-search-to-your-windows-pc/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/experimental-google-app-brings-web-and-local-search-to-your-windows-pc/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n                        ",

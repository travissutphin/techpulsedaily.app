  "content": "Never have I seen such low-quality reviews from an A\\* conference. I understand that there was a record number of submissions, but come on. A lot of issues mentioned in the reviews can be answered by actually reading the main text. The reviews also lack so much detail to the point where it's not even constructive criticism, but rather a bunch of nitpicky reasons for rejection. AAAI needs to do better.",

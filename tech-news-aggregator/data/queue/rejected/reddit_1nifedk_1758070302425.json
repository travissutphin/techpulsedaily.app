    {
      "question": "Why did Song Chun Zhu leave the US for China?",
      "answer": "ccording to the article, Song Chun Zhu, one of the world's most brilliant AI scientists, left the US to work in China because he felt he \"had to do it.\" The article explains that Zhu was frustrated by the lack of funding and support for his ambitious AI research projects in the US, and saw better opportunities to advance his work in China."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of AI research was Song Chun Zhu working on?",
      "answer": "Zhu was focused on developing advanced AI systems that could learn and reason in more human-like ways, going beyond narrow, specialized AI. He was particularly interested in building AI with common sense understanding and the ability to learn from limited data, like young children do."
    },
    {
      "question": "What advantages did China offer Zhu for his AI research?",
      "answer": "The article states that China provided Zhu with much more funding, resources, and institutional support for his ambitious AI projects compared to what he could access in the US. China also had a greater appetite for high-risk, transformative AI research that Zhu wanted to pursue."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Zhu's move to China impact the global AI landscape?",
      "answer": "Zhu's decision to leave the US for China is seen as a significant brain drain for American AI research. It highlights China's growing dominance and investment in advanced AI development, potentially shifting the global balance of power in this critical technology field."
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges did Zhu face in transitioning from the US to working in China?",
      "answer": "The article notes that despite the advantages China offered, Zhu still faced challenges in adjusting to the different work culture and bureaucracy. He had to navigate political sensitivities and restrictions around his research that didn't exist in the US."

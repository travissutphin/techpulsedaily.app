# Railway Setup Instructions - Volume-Based CMS

## üéØ Goal
Enable production admin panel to manage articles (scrape‚Üíapprove‚Üípublish) with persistent storage on Railway volume.

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables

**Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables ‚Üí Add Variable**

Add these two critical variables:

```
Variable Name: CONTENT_DIR
Value: /app/data/content
```

```
Variable Name: DATA_DIR
Value: /app/data
```

**Why these are needed:**
- `CONTENT_DIR=/app/data/content` - Publisher writes MDX files here (on volume)
- `DATA_DIR=/app/data` - Queue system stores articles here (on volume)
- PathResolver reads these env vars and uses volume paths instead of git paths
- Articles persist across Railway redeployments

### Step 2: Deploy

After adding environment variables:

1. Click **"Deploy"** button in Railway dashboard
2. Wait for deployment to complete (~60-90 seconds)
3. Check deployment logs for confirmation

**Look for in logs:**
```
üìÅ Directory Structure:
  Data Dir: /app/data (volume)
  Content Dir: /app/data/content (env controlled)
  Queue Dir: /app/data/queue
```

### Step 3: Verify Production Admin Workflow

Visit: `https://techpulsedailyapp-production.up.railway.app/admin`

**Test complete workflow:**

1. **Scrape articles**
   - Click "Scrape Articles" button
   - Wait for processing to complete
   - Verify articles appear in "Pending Review" tab

2. **Approve articles**
   - Review pending articles
   - Click "Approve" on desired articles
   - Verify they move to "Approved" tab

3. **Publish articles**
   - Go to "Approved" tab
   - Click "Publish Approved Articles" button
   - Wait for publishing to complete

4. **Verify on home page**
   - Visit: `https://techpulsedailyapp-production.up.railway.app/`
   - Articles should appear on home page
   - No git commit required!

### Step 4: Verify Persistence

**Test that articles survive redeployment:**

1. Publish some articles via admin panel
2. Trigger a redeploy (Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deploy)
3. After deployment completes, visit home page
4. Articles should still be visible

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No articles published yet" on home page

**Check:**
```bash
# Via Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Shell (if available)
ls -la /app/data/content/posts
```

**Should show:**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 nextjs nodejs 2025-10-05-article-slug.mdx
```

**If directory is empty:**
- Environment variables not set correctly
- Re-check CONTENT_DIR and DATA_DIR values
- Redeploy after fixing

### Issue: Permission denied errors

**Check logs for:**
```
Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/app/data/content'
```

**Fix:**
- Entrypoint script should handle this automatically
- Check docker-entrypoint.sh is executable
- Verify volume is mounted at `/app/data`

### Issue: Articles disappear after redeploy

**Root cause:**
- CONTENT_DIR not set (using git path `/app/content` instead of volume `/app/data/content`)
- Volume not properly mounted

**Fix:**
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check Railway volume configuration (Service ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Volumes)

## üìä Expected Behavior

**After this setup:**

‚úÖ Admin panel on production scrapes articles
‚úÖ Articles can be approved/rejected directly on production
‚úÖ Published articles appear on production home page
‚úÖ Articles persist across Railway redeployments
‚úÖ No git commits needed for article management
‚ùå Localhost and production have separate article databases

**Localhost workflow (unchanged):**
- Use for development/testing
- Scrape, approve, publish locally
- Local articles stored in `./data/` directory (not synced to production)

**Production workflow (new CMS approach):**
- Manage articles entirely through production admin panel
- Articles stored on Railway volume `/app/data/`
- Persist across deployments
- Independent from git repository

## üéâ Success Checklist

- [ ] CONTENT_DIR environment variable set to `/app/data/content`
- [ ] DATA_DIR environment variable set to `/app/data`
- [ ] Railway deployment successful with correct logs
- [ ] Can scrape articles on production admin
- [ ] Can approve articles on production admin
- [ ] Can publish articles on production admin
- [ ] Published articles visible on production home page
- [ ] Articles persist after triggering new deployment
- [ ] No git commits required for article publishing

## üìù Notes

- This approach treats production as a true CMS
- Localhost remains for development/testing
- Article content managed separately on each environment
- Railway volume provides persistent storage
- PathResolver uses environment variables for path resolution

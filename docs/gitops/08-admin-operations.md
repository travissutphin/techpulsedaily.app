curl -X POST -H "x-api-key: admin-session-key" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/scrape
```

---

### Articles Not Appearing After Publish

curl -X POST -H "x-api-key: admin-session-key" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/admin/debug
```

2. Verify `CONTENT_DIR` set correctly:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "x-api-key: admin-session-key" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/admin/debug-env
```

3. See [Troubleshooting Guide](./06-troubleshooting.md#homepage-issues)

---

### Can't Login to Dashboard

**Check:**
1. Correct URL: `/admin` (not `/admin/`)
2. Username matches `ADMIN_USERNAME` env var
3. Password correct
4. Browser cookies enabled

**Reset Password:**
```bash
# Generate new hash
node -e "console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync('new-password', 10))"

# Update ADMIN_PASSWORD env var with hash
```

## Security Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ

1. **Use strong passwords** (12+ characters)
2. **Log out when done** (especially on shared computers)
3. **Review before publishing** (quality control)
4. **Monitor published content** (check homepage daily)
5. **Backup regularly** (data directory)

### DON'T ‚ùå

1. **Don't share credentials** (each admin gets own account - future)
2. **Don't publish without review** (always human oversight)
3. **Don't ignore warnings** (investigate issues)
4. **Don't leave logged in** (security risk)
5. **Don't bulk approve** (quality over quantity)

## Performance Tips

### Speed Up Review Process

1. **Skim first** - Read quality score and title

4. **Batch review** - Review all pending at once
5. **Set time limit** - 10-15 minutes max per session

### Optimize Publishing

1. **Publish in batches** - 5-10 articles at once
2. **Off-peak hours** - Less traffic impact
3. **Monitor homepage** - Ensure articles appear
4. **Check sitemap** - Verify SEO updated

---

## Analytics Integration (Future)

**Planned:**
- Article view counts
- Engagement metrics
- Quality score trends

## Next Steps

After mastering admin operations:
1. Read [Security Guide](./09-security.md) for best practices
